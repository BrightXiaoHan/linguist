This addon can be used on mobile browsers with [Firefox Nightly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix) (Recommended), or with any chromium browser that supports extensions.

To try it on Firefox, you must add the [Linguist add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/linguist-translator/) to a [custom add-on collection](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/10/01/you-can-now-install-any-add-on-in-firefox-nightly-for-android-but-it-is-complicated/) and using this collection to install the extension.

To try it on a chromium browser, download the normal extension for Chrome.

# Features

Linguist is very convenient to use.

- Real time page translations without reloading
- Translate selected text segments
- Translate input text manually
- Dictionary for saving important translations
- Supports all translation services (even your own service)

Supported translators out of the box:

- Google
- Yandex
- Bing

You can also use your own custom service (in development).

You control all your data and can download your personal dictionary and other data at any time.

Linguist cares about your traffic and uses a cache. If you translate a page or a phrase once, you can do it again at any time, even without an internet connection. The cache may be disabled if you want to translate private data.

# Why it better than online translation services?

When you use a translation service, you can't translate pages which require authorization, because online services can only translate public pages. Also, online services collect your personal data, track you and give you only one translator, but linguist may use any translate service. It may even use a local translation service that translates your data on your PC without any internet.

# Why it better than other extensions for translate?

It's free, open source, supports all translation services and does not collect your personal data.

This extension allows you to not only translate text on pages, but to translate anything you wish and to keep these important translations for yourself. It's like your personal translator on the internet.

It is for making life a little more comfortable, for all users of the internet.
